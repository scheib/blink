This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL TimedItem.localTime and TimedItem.currentIteration are null when animation is not associated with a Player assert_equals: expected (object) null but got (undefined) undefined
PASS TimedItem.localTime and TimedItem.currentIteration return reasonable values when an animation is in effect 
FAIL TimedItem.currentIteration is null when animation is not in effect assert_equals: expected (object) null but got (undefined) undefined
PASS TimedItem startTime, endTime, duration, activeDuration are sensible for a simple animation 
PASS TimedItem startTime, endTime, duration, activeDuration are sensible for animations with delays and iterations 
PASS TimedItem duration is calculated when no duration is specified 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
